**RG Frontend Linters** is a solution designed to standardize configurations for **ESLint**, **Stylelint**, and **CommitLint**,
ensuring consistent code quality, styling, and commit message validation across projects. By abstracting the configuration logic into reusable modules,
this approach streamlines the integration process for developers, reduces onboarding time, and enforces consistent standards across teams and projects.

Key Features and Benefits
-------------------------

1. **Centralized Configuration Management**

   Developers can leverage predefined configurations for **ESLint**, **Stylelint**, and **CommitLint**, eliminating the need for project-specific setup.
   This centralization ensures that all projects follow the same conventions, reducing discrepancies and improving maintainability.

2. **Modular and Reusable Design**

   The ``createConfig`` function allows easy initialization of linter configurations. Teams can extend the default configurations with
   custom rules tailored to specific project requirements, promoting flexibility without sacrificing consistency.

3. **Simplified Setup Process**

   Adding the package as a dependency and initializing the configurations requires minimal effort. This reduces the setup overhead,
   enabling developers to focus on coding rather than configuration.

4. **Consistency Across Projects**

   Uniform linting and formatting rules enhance readability, simplify collaboration, and reduce code review friction.
   Commit message validation ensures adherence to version control standards, further promoting structured development workflows.

Inspired by Frontend Build Repository
--------------------------------------

The concept for **RG Frontend Linters** draws inspiration from the **frontend-build** repository, which similarly provides centralized
configurations for JavaScript testing and linting. Adopting this approach ensures that all tools in the development ecosystem,
including linters and test frameworks, follow a unified configuration pattern across Open edX ecosystem. This alignment fosters standardization and makes
configurations easier to manage and extend.
